                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the ever-evolving world of technology, the role of a software developer and project manager is crucial.
                        Today, we have the pleasure of interviewing Ranjit Singh, a seasoned professional at Mastercard. 
                        He shares insights about the future prospects of the job, salary expectations, personal reflections, and advice for aspiring professionals. Let's dive into the conversation.

                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2 class="center1">Question 1:</h2>
                    <h3>What do you see as the future prospects for software developers and project managers in the tech industry, 
                        particularly at large tech firms?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The future prospect is quite promising as with the advancements in technology there is a growing demand for 
                        skilled software developers and project managers. Here in  Mastercard, we are constantly working to stay ahead in the 
                        fintech space. The integration of AI, machine learning, and blockchain technology is creating new opportunities 
                        and challenges. For those who are willing to adapt and learn, the future holds immense potential especially in the software sector

                    <p>It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.</p>

                    <h2 class="center1">Question 2:</h2>
                
                    <h3>What was the path that you took to get into this proffession</h3>
                    <p>My journey was quite unique, as I had an MCA (Mster of Computer Applications) degree from a university in Punjab and using that,
                        I got a job at a very small software comapny in India which was an IT cell on behalf of Mastercard during that time. 
                        Not soon after that, Mastercard UK bought the whole company and our small team, which was transfered to the UK,
                         with a majority of us in the team going with it to the UK for operations there.

                        <li>So baboon this</li>
                        <li>Mounted militant weasel gregariously admonishingly straightly hey</li>
                        <li>Dear foresaw hungry and much some overhung</li>
                        <li>Rash opossum less because less some amid besides yikes jeepers frenetic impassive fruitlessly shut</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The future is incredibly promising. With the rapid advancements in technology, there's a growing demand for 
                        skilled software developers and project managers. At Mastercard, we're constantly innovating to stay ahead 
                        in the fintech space. The integration of AI, machine learning, and blockchain technology is creating new 
                        opportunities and challenges. For those willing to adapt and learn, the future holds immense potential</p>

                    <h2 class="center1">Question 3:</h2>
                
                    <h3>Can you provide an idea of the salary range for software developers and project managers at Mastercard?</h3>
                    
                    <p>My salary range for working here at Mastercard Uk is around {U+00A3}600K </p>

                    <p>Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.

                    <p>She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a copy.</p>

                    <h6>Slapped cozy a that lightheartedly and far</h6>
                    <p>The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country. But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects again and again.</p>
