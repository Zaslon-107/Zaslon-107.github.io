                    <h2 class="center1">Question 1:</h2>
                    <h3>What was your journey on getting into this career?

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        My journey was a similar one to that of my husband, in that we both had studied and got degrees and certifications from 
                        universities in Punjab, and we started work pretty early on in the software sector. 
                        I had to move to the UK immediately following my husband’s relocation to Mastercard, and this was right after I had finished
                         my degree in the MCA program. This degree was all about computer science and the inner workings of computer systems and software. 
                         This degree would be roughly equivalent to a computer science degree here in the west. After the relocation, I
                          was employed by a private networking company from where I gained some experience and was able to get into mastercard and specialize
                           in the new blockchain technology at that time.

                    </p>
                    
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="center1">Question 2:</h2>
                
                    <h3>What skills and qualifications are most important for a career in such careers like blockchain development and related fields?</h3>
                    <p>To start off, I would say that proficiency in languages like Solidity, JavaScript, and Python is crucial to developing smart contracts
                         and blockchain applications. Knowledge wise, a deep understanding of cryptographic principles and 
                         distributed ledger technology(synchronised and distributed digital data) is necessary to ensure security and efficiency to all users 
                         of your platform. Practical experience through projects or degrees and continuous learning to stay updated with the 
                         latest technology will significantly help your career prospects in such a rapidly evolving field as blockchain is.

                    </p>
                   
                  
                    
                    <h2 class="center1">Question 3:</h2>
                
                    <h3>What does a typical day look like in your role?
                    </h3>
                    
                    <p>A typical day in my role involves a majority of technical and collaborative tasks. I start by reviewing project updates and 
                        addressing any urgent issues and upsets with my team. Throughout the day we collaborate with developers to design and create 
                        blockchain solutions, for our financial division and to meet our security and performance standards. 

                    </p>
                    
                    
                    <h2 class="center4">Question 4:</h2>

                    <h3>How do you see this industry evolving over the next few years?
                    </h3>

                    <p>The blockchain industry is predicted to have lots of growth and transformation over the next few years. 
                        You can expect to see increased adoption of blockchain technology in various sectors, mainly finance, supply chain, and healthcare. 
                        Innovations in scalability, compatibility, and regulatory frameworks will drive mainstream acceptance and integration. also, 
                        the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) will continue to create new 
                        opportunities for the newer generations.</p>
                      
                    
                    
                    
                    <h2 class="center4">Question 5:</h2>

                    <h3>What advice would you give to someone just starting out in this career?
                    </h3>

                    <p>For someone thats just starting out in a blockchain career, my advice would be to focus on getting good in
                         computer science and cryptography. Get hands-on experience with blockchain platforms like Ethereum and Hyperledger,
                          and learn programming languages such as Solidity and Python. Staying updated with the latest trends and advancements 
                          in the blockchain space is also very important, as it's a rapidly evolving field. And lastly, you shouldn’t underestimate
                           the value of networking which means to connect with professionals in the industry like me, attend conferences, and
                            participate in online forums to learn more about such fields.
