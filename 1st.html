                    <h3>What do you see as the future prospects for software developers and project managers in the tech industry, 
                        particularly at large tech firms?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The future prospect is quite promising as with the advancements in technology there is a growing demand for 
                        skilled software developers and project managers. Here in  Mastercard, we are always working to stay ahead in the 
                        fintech. The integration of AI, machine learning, and other technology is creating new opportunities 
                        and challenges. For those who are willing to adapt and learn, the future holds great potential in the software sector

                    <h3>What was the path that you took to get into this proffession</h3>
                    <p>My journey was quite unique, as I had an MCA (Master of Computer Applications) degree from Lyallpur Khalsa college in Punjab and using that,
                        I got a job at a very small software company in India which was an IT cell on behalf of Mastercard during that time. 
                        Not soon after that, Mastercard UK bought the whole company and our small team, which was transferred to the UK,
                         with a majority of us in the team going with it to the UK for operations there.

                    </ol>
                    <p>The future is incredibly promising. With the rapid advancements in technology, there's a growing demand for 
                        skilled software developers and project managers. At Mastercard, we're constantly innovating to stay ahead 
                        in the fintech space. The integration of AI, machine learning, and blockchain technology is creating new 
                        opportunities and challenges. For those willing to adapt and learn, the future holds immense potential</p>
                    
                    
                    <h2 class="center1">Question 3:</h2>
                
                    <h3>Can you provide an idea of the salary range for software developers and project managers at Mastercard?</h3>
                    
                    <p>My salary range for working here at Mastercard UK is around £600 000 pounds which is very high in comparison to the junior devs around here
                        , but this is because I have worked here for around 20 years now since the early 2000s. You can expect the salary for junior devs and other
                          entry level positions to be around £40k-£70k here in the UK while more experienced devs will have much more pay as a result of thier extensive career and expertise.

                    <h2 class="center4">Question 4:</h2>

                    <h3>How do you feel at the end of the day?
                    </h3>

                    <p>At the end of a long day of programming and managing our teams, I feel both satisfaction and exhaustion. 
                        It's like eating a heavy meal, like you're full and bloated but  are also ready to sleep. 
                        The satisfaction of solving complex problems and creating something valuable is greatly rewarding. 
                        But, the mental fatigue is important to balance work with my family

When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a copy.</p>
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    <h2 class="center4">Question 5:</h2>

                    <h3>What do you think of in worries that how AI might take over this job?
                    </h3>

                    <p>I personally believe the opposite because for us devs, we see AI as just tools and productivity enhancers. 
                        Sure, AI might give you all the code you might need and will even reslove bugs and other issues, 
                        but it simply can't create whole programs and systems by itself, esspecially massive ones like what we make here at our big firms. 
                        We let the AIs write out the low-level code and have our guys structure and debug it, again, it only serve as tools and boost 
                        our productivity to get more done in less time.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="center4">Question 6:</h2>

                    <h3>What would help me prepare for this career?
                    </h3>

                    <p>To prepare for a career in software programming you have to first build a strong foundation in programming, data structures, and debugging. Start with languages like Python or Java and then learn to program in different styles such as Object-oriented programming , Functional programming,etc.
                       Keep yourself updated with the latest technologies and trends in the industry. 
                       Practical experience from internships or large-scale projects is the most important as is it gives job-like experience. 
                       Most importantly, consistency and practice is the single most stressed and important thing in getting better at programming.
